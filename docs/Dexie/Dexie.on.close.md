### Syntax

```javascript
db.on("close", () => console.log("db was closed"));
```

### Description

The "close" event occurs if database is forcibly closed from external action. The event is not fired when calling db.close(). From dexie@4.1.0 (currently in alpha), this event is also fired as a CustomEvent when db.close() is called explicitely or implicitely and not just when forcibly closed from outside.
